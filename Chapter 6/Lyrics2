[Intro]

I wish that it, I wish it was really raining outside, like it was last week
Cuz that'dve been good for the mood

[Chorus]

I only think about your a-- when it rains in L.A
And that's okay, that's okay, it never rains anyway
Used to trip, used to trip, yeah that pains me to say
I only think about your a-- when it rains in L.A

[Verse 1]

Yeah
I know you think about the old days, sick of all my old ways
You tell me you past that, you told me to go away
I gave you my time girl that's something I don't throw away
Yeah I know the time girl, I had to call I know its late
Baby you get so impatient, why you so impatient?
I been drinking all night so you know I'm wasted
I been lookin for somebody you got no replacement
You like "Don't you gas me up I dont need no inflation"
We don't smoke like we used to, drink like we used to
Oh you think you poppin see you hangin with The Who's Who
Act like you forgot I introduced you
 

[Chorus]

I only think about your ass when it rains in L.A
And that's okay, that's okay, it never rains anyway
Used to trip, used to trip, yeah that pains me to say
I only think about your ass when it rains in L.A

[Verse 2]

Look I ain't tryna' be rude, this Henny got me loose
You been my baby since we babies that's like '92
Now we grown up and you show up in that body suit
And you the only one that glow up in the cloudy room
Taking photos in the Audi, ooh
I know how you do
Got a crib that got a mountain view, and a fountain too
Yeah I get it, you been on the move
Whatchu trying prove?
Girl I bet you'd wouldn't like it if I pulled a you on you
Now my best friend, turned into another one my exes
Less than, just another fuck up on my checklist
Never learn my lesson, take a pill and pop it like the question

[Outro]

I only think about your ass when it rains in L.A
And that's okay, that's okay, it never rains anyway
I still love you, I still love you, yeah that pains me to say
I only think about your ass when it, rain
Feel like it rains everyday
